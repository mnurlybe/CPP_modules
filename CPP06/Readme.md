dynamic_cast in C++ is a type of casting operator that is used to perform safe downcasting and cross-casting among polymorphic types (types with at least one virtual function). It's particularly useful in the context of polymorphism, where you need to determine the actual type of an object pointed to or referenced by a base class pointer or reference.

Key Features of dynamic_cast
Safe Downcasting: dynamic_cast is used to cast pointers or references to base class types to pointers or references to derived class types. It performs a runtime check to ensure that the cast is valid, avoiding undefined behavior if the cast is not appropriate.

Polymorphic Types: To use dynamic_cast, the base class must have at least one virtual function. This ensures that C++ maintains type information (RTTI - Run-Time Type Information) needed for the cast to be performed correctly.

Returns nullptr for Invalid Casts: When casting a pointer, if the cast fails (i.e., the object is not of the target type), dynamic_cast returns nullptr. For references, a failed cast will throw std::bad_cast exception.

Cross-Casting: dynamic_cast can also be used to cast between sibling classes or to check if an object is a certain type at runtime.
